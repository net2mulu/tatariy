                At TATARIY, we lead with experience you can trust and deliver
                with the expertise you need. With over 15 years in federal

                defense, civilian, and SLED missions. Our strength lies in
                delivering end-to-end IT solutions-from enterprise program
                management to cybersecurity, cloud migration, and systems
                integration. We pair that with high-impact talent acquisition
                and people-first training programs to ensure long-term success.
                Every engagement is grounded in operational excellence, mission
                alignment, and a commitment to getting the job done right.
